# Basic-functionality-of-Javascript

I have tried some basic web functionalities using internal javaScript,
such as cookies, local storage and session in first document using a little bit css,
then dialog boxes-alert, prompt, confirm, print any document in pdf format or any 
and redirect to another site, refresh page and delete specific content.
